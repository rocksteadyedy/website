       <b>Index tracking fund (long term investment)</b>
        What is this? An index tracking fund replicates - or ‘tracks’ - the performance of an index by investing in all the shares quoted on it. For example, a FTSE 100 index tracker will invest in every one of the top 100 UK companies
        
        This means if the FTSE 100 rises by 5%, the value of your investment will increase accordingly (with a deduction for fund charges and a tracking error - which represents how closely the fund matches changes in the index). Equally, if the FTSE 100 drops by 5%, your investment will drop by roughly the same amount.
        
        Luckily, if you’d rather not spend endless hours picking your own stocks, you don’t have to with a simple Investment Strategy known as INDEX TRACKING.
        
        All you need to do is decide which index you would like to track. For example, you can stick to the home market if you wish. If you want an investment that covers the majority of UK listed companies, choose a FTSE All Share tracker - rather than one based on the FTSE 100 - and you’ll gain exposure to around 98% of the market.
        
        You can buy an index tracker via an investment platform, or fund supermarket as they're also known, such as <a href="https://www.hl.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hargreaves Lansdown</a> or <a href="https://www.bestinvest.co.uk/" target="_blank">BestInvest</a>

        <b>Whiskey</b> Experts say rare whisky is a good long-term bet and prices are up 582% in the last decade. When stock markets plunge, investors flock to 'safe havens' to protect their wealth. One such classic, gold, is up 21 per cent in the past year and hitting six-year highs, while the FTSE-100 is ahead just one per cent

        The most obvious way to begin investing in whiskey is to purchase some highly valuable collectible whiskeys. Investors simply store these valuable bottles for several years as their value increases, then they are sold for a profit.
        
        So the Strategy we'll be using is simply buy and hold. You will buy at <a href="https://www.whiskyinvestdirect.com/" target="_blank">WhiskyInvestDirect</a> where you will have a choice of fine rare whisky, it'll be held and stored for you. The longer it matures the more valuable it'll become. Years down the line if you choose, you will sell for a profit

        <b>Gold</b>Quite simply there are companies that you can buy gold from. It can be either bullions or coins. The Strategy here will be to buy and hold. Rather than physically holding them at home, companies will store them like <a href="https://www.bullionvault.com/" target="_blank">Bullionvault</a>When you decide to sell, the company will sell and transfer funds into your account.
